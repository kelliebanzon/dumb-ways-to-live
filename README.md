# dumb-ways-to-live
In summer of 2015, I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at the Mount Saint Mary's University campus in downtown Los Angeles. Dumb Ways to Live is the final project I created in collaboration with classmates Veronica Holmes and Tei Park, inspired by the 2012 Metro PSA "Dumb Ways to Die."
